#include<iostream.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int variable;
	cin>>variable;
	cout<<"The input is : "<<variable;
	return 0;
}



** In CPP, we must always be using return type for main function as "int" only, if we use void main like C language, it will show the error as it is expecting int main.
 
** The standard header file which will store the input and output functions is : <iostream>
							Ex : #include<iostream>

** When using cin and cout, we must specify the keyword, std, everytime, if you want to avoid it, you can use a generalized statement : using namespace std;
