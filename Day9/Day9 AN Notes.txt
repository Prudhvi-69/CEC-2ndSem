STL (Standard Template Library) : It is going to provide the functions, classes and templates which are already coded, loaded and ready to use.
** With the help of STL, we can reduce the time taken to run some processes, programs, operations.
** STL will provide 3 types of advantages. They are, 
1. Containers 
2. Alogrithms
3. Iterators

1. Containers : Containers are going to store data, organize data, work under multiple operations and scenarios.
** Sample : Vector, List, Stack, Queue. 
** You can access all containers with the specific header file.


Vector : Vector is a container which is going to work as similar to an Array.
** The difference is, in an Array, we have limited and fixed size for it.
** In Vector, we can increase the size of the array when extra is needed, decrease when we want to save space.
** It will provide access for builtin functions,which will make our program execution easy.
** Implementation of vector can be done,with the help of 
	the header file : #include<vector>

** We can insert elements into a vector in 3 ways.

** Functions to to insert values into the Vector : 
	1. push_back()  : used to insert an element at the ending
	2. insert() : takes two parameters and insert the element at the specified 							index
