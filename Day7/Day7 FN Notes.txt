Dynamic Memory Allocation : It is allocating memory/space to the variables inside the Storage/Memory.
** Only difference from a normal memory allocation is, 
			-> Normal memory allocation will use the space inside the Stack.
			-> Dynamic Memory allocation will use the space inside Heap.

** The memory allocated using Heap, will be flexible to work with.
** That memory space can be deleted once the usage is done in the program.
** In Static Memory allocation, the space allocated for variables will be deleted or freed once the program execution is finished.
** With Dynamic Memory allocation, we can delete the variable space/memory when not needed, in the middle of the program.

** To allocate memory dynamically, we are going to use the keyword, "new" at the time of declaring the variable.
** Once the usage with the variable is done, we can deallocate the memory using the keyword : "delete"
